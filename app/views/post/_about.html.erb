                <p>My full name is Benjamin Seabrook Barnett.  I use my middle name "Seabrook" on the web for Google rankings and because I think it reads well.</p>
<p>I have studied independently and formally in the field of Computer Science for several years.  My (soon to be) most recent accomplishment will be graduating from The Iron Yard: Ruby on Rails intensive bootcamp.</p>
                <p>I currently volunteer for two charities in California as an on-call Web-Developer.  I love my volunteering duties and hope to continue on helping similar causes.  If you would like to know more about me or just have a question in general, drop me a line!  My info can be found on the contact page.</p>
